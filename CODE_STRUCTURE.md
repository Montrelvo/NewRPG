# Plan for Code Structure Documentation for "NewRPG" Game

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed overview of the code structure for the "NewRPG" game, focusing on the core files that initialize and run the Phaser game.

### 2. Project Overview

The project is a Phaser-based game. The `index.html` file serves as the entry point, loading the Phaser library and the main game script. `src/main.js` configures and initializes the Phaser game, registering the `Start` scene. `src/scenes/Start.js` defines the initial game scene, handling asset loading, sprite creation, animations, and game logic.

### 3. File-by-File Documentation

#### `index.html`

* **Purpose:** The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the game.
* **Key Elements:**
* Includes the `phaser.js` library.
* Includes `src/main.js` as a module, which initializes the Phaser game.
* Contains a `<div id="game-container">` where the Phaser canvas will be rendered.

#### `phaser.js`

* **Purpose:** The Phaser game engine library. This file provides all the necessary functionalities for game development, including rendering, physics, input handling, and scene management.

#### `src/main.js`

* **Purpose:** Configures and initializes the Phaser game instance.
* **Key Elements:**
* Imports the `Start` scene from [`./scenes/Start.js`](src/scenes/Start.js).
* Defines the `config` object for the Phaser game, specifying:
  * `type`: `Phaser.AUTO` (automatically detects WebGL or Canvas).
  * `title`, `description`, `parent`.
  * `width`, `height`: Game dimensions (1280x720).
  * `backgroundColor`.
  * `scene`: An array listing the scenes to be included in the game, starting with `Start`.
  * `scale`: Configuration for scaling the game to fit the screen.
* Creates a new `Phaser.Game` instance using the defined `config`.

#### `src/scenes/Start.js`

* **Purpose:** Defines the initial game scene, responsible for loading assets, creating game objects, and handling initial game logic.
* **Key Elements:**
* Exports the `Start` class, which extends `Phaser.Scene`.
* **`constructor()`:** Initializes the scene with the key 'Start'.
* **`preload()`:** Loads game assets:
  * `background` image (`assets/space.png`).
  * `logo` image (`assets/phaser.png`).
  * `ship` spritesheet (`assets/spaceship.png`) with frame dimensions.
* **`create()`:** Sets up the initial game state:
  * Adds a `tileSprite` for the background.
  * Adds the Phaser `logo` image.
  * Adds the `ship` sprite.
  * Creates an animation (`fly`) for the `ship` sprite using frames from the spritesheet.
  * Plays the `fly` animation.
  * Adds a tween animation to the `logo` for vertical movement.
* **`update()`:** Game loop method, called every frame:
  * Updates the `tilePositionX` of the background to create a scrolling effect.

### 5. Conclusion

This documentation outlines the foundational structure of the "NewRPG" game, demonstrating how `index.html` orchestrates the loading of the Phaser engine and the main game script, which in turn initializes and manages the game scenes and their assets.
